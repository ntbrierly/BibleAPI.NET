# BibleAPI.NET
Provide a wrapper for Bible APIs for use in .NET projects.  Beginning with Digital Bible Platform.

The purpose of this project is to enable .NET developers to access Bible APIs such as Digital Bible Platform and the NET Bible API.

We will begin with Digital Bible Platform, but eventually I'd like to include the NET Bible API and perhaps the ESV web api from Crossway.
